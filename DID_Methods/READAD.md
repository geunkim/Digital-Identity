### a persistent global identifier system
A self-authenticating Decentralized Identifier(DID) system: strongly-consistent, recoverable, allowing key rotation

which allows accounts to retain relationships while changing names or migrating between service providers. 
It makes use of cryptography and gives individuals (or organizations) direct control and ownership over their identitifier, 

but does not make use of any blockchain or cryptocurrency technology, 
and is inexpensive enough to provide as a no-cost service.
